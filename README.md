**Plans for each Milestone** <br/>
-------------------
<br/>
Our updated plan for each milestone:- <br/>
Milestone 1 (Project Ideation): <br/>
- [x] Finalise on the project idea and the workflow of the application <br/>
- [x] Decide on the modes available and the basic tabs in the application <br/>
- [x] Finish learning Java <br/>
- [x] Learn Android and CRUD in Android <br/>
<br/>

Milestone 2 (creating a Minimum Viable Project): <br/>
- [x] Finish the learning phase <br/>
- [x] Implement a basic working application  <br/>
- [x] Get navigation panel done <br/>
- [x] Work on the user interface of the application <br/>
<br/>

Milestone 3 (Minimum Viable Project): <br/>
- [x] Further substantiate the learning phase <br/>
- [x] Implement pop up for expense as well as CRUD  <br/>
- [x] Further improve navigation panel <br/>

<br/>

Provided that we are able to finish building the basic features of Tap n Track, we also plan to work on some of these extensions:- <br/>
- [x] Feedback form for users that is in sync with google form <br/>
- [ ] EZ-Link card history integration <br/>
- [ ] Feature to export the information to excel sheet <br/>
- [ ] Allow users to take photo of their receipts as inputs of expenditures <br/>
- [ ] A mode for group projects and collaboration. Sync with other users (eg. for groups, enable read-only mode for viewers and editable mode for collaborators) <br/>
<br/>

**Planned Features** <br/>
-------------------
<br/>

We plan to have the following features in the application:- <br/>
- Overview which allows two modes - Budget and Normal <br/>
- Each mode shows the income,expenditure, balance and the analysis of the expenditure <br/>
- Users to be able to input income or expenditure with a description and associate it with one of the many categories <br/>
- History of the inputs sorted by date <br/>
- Income tab shows the income in different categories (cash, cards etc) <br/>
- Expenditure tab shows the expenditure either by date or by category <br/>
- In the Settings, we plan to allow the user to customise the application with different colours and personalised categories (if possible) <br/>
<br/>

**User Stories** <br/>
-------------------
<br/>

1. As a user, I want to monitor my finances well with a simple and user-friendly application that has a nice user interface.  <br/>
2. As a user, I want to login to my account to input new income or expenditure with a description, or to view and manage my money flow. <br/>
3. As a user, I want to set a budget for my expenses and be notified before or when I overspend. <br/>
4. As a user, I want to set recurring expenses so that I do not have to input the same expenses every month. <br/>
5. As a user, I want to export my money flow history so that I can keep a record or share it with others, such as my family. <br/>
6. As a non-administrative user, I want to view and keep track of the budget and money flow with my groupmates or working partners. <br/>
7. As a mobile application developer, I want to receive feedback from the users of my application and regularly improve and update my application to provide good user experience. <br/>
